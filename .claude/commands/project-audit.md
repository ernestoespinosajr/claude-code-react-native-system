# Project Audit Command - Technological Assessment

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive technological audit of the project, evaluating architecture, code quality, dependencies, security, and opportunities for improvement.

## Usage
Run periodically (weekly or bi-weekly) to maintain project health and identify areas for improvement.

## Audit Categories

### 1. üèóÔ∏è Architecture Analysis
**What to evaluate**:
- Project structure and organization
- Component hierarchy and relationships
- Navigation patterns and routing
- State management implementation
- Data flow patterns

**Questions to assess**:
- Is the folder structure logical and scalable?
- Are components properly separated by concerns?
- Is navigation intuitive and efficient?
- Is state management consistent and predictable?
- Are there circular dependencies or tight coupling issues?

### 2. üì¶ Dependencies & Stack Health
**What to evaluate**:
- Package.json dependencies analysis
- Version compatibility and security
- Bundle size and performance impact
- Unused or redundant dependencies
- Missing critical dependencies

**Checks to perform**:
- Outdated packages that need updates
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- License compatibility issues
- Alternative packages that might be better
- Dependencies that can be removed

### 3. üí° Code Quality Assessment
**What to evaluate**:
- Code consistency and patterns
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- Error handling implementation
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code duplication and reusability

**Analysis areas**:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Error boundaries and try-catch usage
- Expensive operations and optimizations
- Reusable components and utilities

### 4. üîí Security & Best Practices
**What to evaluate**:
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and sanitization
- Secure storage practices
- API security considerations
- Privacy and data protection

**Security checks**:
- Sensitive data exposure
- Input validation completeness
- Secure token storage
- API endpoint security
- User data privacy compliance

### 5. üöÄ Performance & Optimization
**What to evaluate**:
- App startup time and bundle size
- Memory usage and leaks
- Rendering performance
- Network requests efficiency
- Image and asset optimization

**Performance metrics**:
- Bundle size analysis
- Render performance bottlenecks
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Network request optimization
- Asset loading strategies

### 6. üì± User Experience & Accessibility
**What to evaluate**:
- Navigation intuitiveness
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-platform consistency
- Offline functionality

**UX assessment**:
- User flow completeness
- Error message clarity
- Accessibility features
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Offline/poor network handling
