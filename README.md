# Feature-Driven Context Engineering System

A revolutionary AI-assisted development system that uses **Context Engineering** principles to optimize AI performance through **feature-driven development** across any programming language or framework.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Feature-Driven Development**: Focus on one feature at a time with complete context isolation
- **Context Engineering**: Use 11-Layer Context Architecture for optimal AI performance  
- **Language Agnostic**: Automatically adapt to any programming language or framework
- **Quality First**: Every feature must pass validation gates before completion
- **Iterative Excellence**: Continuous improvement through context optimization

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. System Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ernestoespinosajr/claude-context-engine.git
cd claude-context-engine

# Initialize the context engineering system
# The system will auto-detect your project type and language
```

### 2. Start Your First Feature
```bash
# For new projects - initialize the project structure
/context-engineer "Set up [language] project with [framework]"
/execute-context project-setup

# For existing projects - add your first feature
/context-engineer "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
/execute-context user-authentication

# Monitor progress and health
/context-status user-authentication
```

## üìã Core Commands

### `/context-engineer "[feature description]"`
**Creates comprehensive feature implementation plans**

- **Auto-detects** project language, framework, and structure
- **Builds** 11-layer context architecture focused on the feature
- **Generates** detailed Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

```
Layer 11: User Query (Current Request)
Layer 10: Immediate Context (Current Feature)
Layer 9: Session Context (Development Session)
Layer 8: Feature Context (Related Features)
Layer 7: Project Context (Current Project)
Layer 6: Domain Knowledge (Technical Expertise)
Layer 5: External Context (APIs, Dependencies)
Layer 4: Historical Context (Past Decisions)
Layer 3: Constraints (Technical Limitations)
Layer 2: Goals (Feature Objectives)
Layer 1: System Instructions (Core Behavior)
```

- **Noise Level**: <10% (Irrelevant information percentage)
- **Efficiency Score**: >80% (Context window utilization)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### For New Projects
```bash
1. /context-engineer "Set up [language] project with [framework]"
2. /execute-context project-setup
3. /context-engineer "Add [core feature]"
4. /execute-context [core-feature]
5. /context-status  # Monitor overall health
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for additional features
```

### For Existing Projects
```bash
1. /context-engineer "Add [new feature]"
2. /context-status [new-feature]  # Check dependencies
3. /execute-context [new-feature]
4. /context-status  # Verify no regressions
```

## üìñ Example Workflows

### üöÄ Complete Step-by-Step Example
Here's a complete walkthrough showing the full lifecycle of a feature:

#### **Step 1: Create Feature Plan**
```bash
# Claude creates comprehensive implementation plan
/context-engineer "Add user authentication with JWT tokens and biometric login"
```

**What Claude does:**
- Creates `features/planned/user-authentication/` directory
- Generates `implementation-plan.md` with detailed requirements
- Creates `context-layers.md` with 11-layer architecture
- Identifies dependencies and creates `dependencies.md`

#### **Step 2: Move Feature to In-Progress**
```bash
# User manually moves feature to active development
mv features/planned/user-authentication/ features/in-progress/
```

**What the user does:**
- Physically moves the folder when ready to start implementation
- This gives you full control over when development begins

#### **Step 3: Execute Implementation**
```bash
# Claude implements the feature using the generated plan
/execute-context user-authentication
```

**What Claude does:**
- Loads the implementation plan and builds focused context
- Implements code following the plan step by step
- Updates progress in `features/in-progress/user-authentication/progress.md`
- Runs quality gates at each step
- Documents decisions and issues encountered

#### **Step 4: Monitor Progress**
```bash
# Check implementation status and health
/context-status user-authentication
```

**What Claude shows:**
- Current implementation progress (e.g., "Step 3 of 7 completed")
- Quality gate status (‚úÖ Syntax, ‚úÖ Integration, ‚è≥ Testing, ‚è≥ Performance)
- Any issues or blockers found
- Context quality metrics

#### **Step 5: Complete Feature**
```bash
# User moves completed feature to completed folder
mv features/in-progress/user-authentication/ features/completed/
```

**What the user does:**
- Moves folder only after all quality gates pass
- Claude will tell you when the feature is ready for completion

#### **Final Result:**
- `features/completed/user-authentication/` contains:
  - Complete implementation documentation
  - Lessons learned
  - Quality gate results
  - Reusable patterns for similar features

### üì± Adding to Existing Project Example
Using the system with an existing project (e.g., adding multiprofile feature):

#### **Step 1: Integrate Context Engine**
```bash
# In your existing project directory
cd /path/to/your/existing-project

# Clone and integrate Context Engine
git clone https://github.com/ernestoespinosajr/claude-context-engine.git temp-context-engine
cp -r temp-context-engine/.claude/ ./
cp -r temp-context-engine/context-engine/ ./
cp -r temp-context-engine/features/ ./
rm -rf temp-context-engine
```

#### **Step 2: Generate Implementation Plan**
```bash
# Claude analyzes your existing project and creates optimized plan
/context-engineer "Implement multiprofile system for user management"

# OR if you have existing requirements document:
/context-engineer "Implement multiprofile system according to multiprofile-requirements.md"
```

**What Claude does:**
- Auto-detects your project language, framework, and structure
- Analyzes existing codebase for integration points
- Creates `features/planned/multiprofile/` directory with complete implementation plan
- If you reference a requirements document, Claude reads it and incorporates it into the plan
- Identifies potential conflicts with existing features

**üí° Pro Tip:** If you have existing requirements documents, just reference them in the command:
- `/context-engineer "Add payment system according to payment-spec.md"`
- `/context-engineer "Implement chat feature based on chat-requirements.pdf"`
- `/context-engineer "Add dashboard using dashboard-mockups.md and api-docs.md"`

Claude will automatically read and analyze these documents to create a comprehensive implementation plan.

#### **Step 3: Execute with Existing Project Context**
```bash
# Move to active development
mv features/planned/multiprofile/ features/in-progress/

# Implement with full project context
/execute-context multiprofile
```

**What Claude does:**
- Loads your existing project context
- Implements feature without breaking existing functionality
- Maintains consistency with your current code patterns
- Integrates seamlessly with your existing architecture
