# üìã Commands Reference - Claude Code React Native System

## üìä Overview

Complete reference for all slash commands available in the Claude Code React Native System. Each command is designed for specific phases of development workflow.

## üöÄ Project Setup Commands

### `/parse-prd`
**Purpose**: Generate initial task backlog from PRD.md  
**Usage**: `Run once at project start`  
**Prerequisites**: PRD.md must exist with project requirements

**What it does**:
- Reads and analyzes PRD.md completely
- Extracts core features and requirements
- Separates tasks into Phase 1 (Frontend) and Phase 2 (Backend)
- Creates organized task list in claude_tasks.md
- Assigns priorities and estimates
- Stores project context in memory

**Example Output**:
```markdown
# üìã CLAUDE TASKS - MyApp
*Generated from PRD.md on 2025-01-15*

## üèóÔ∏è SETUP TASKS - Phase 1
### üì¶ Project Base Setup - CRITICAL - Phase 1
**Description**: Initialize and configure React Native/Expo project
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (4-6 hours)
```

**When to use**:
- ‚úÖ First time setting up project
- ‚úÖ When PRD.md is significantly updated
- ‚ùå During regular development (use other commands)

**Troubleshooting**:
- If no tasks generated: Check PRD.md has sufficient detail
- If error occurs: Ensure PRD.md exists and is readable
- If categories missing: Add more specific features to PRD

### `/analyze-complexity`
**Purpose**: Analyze task complexity with web research  
**Usage**: `After /parse-prd or when adding new complex tasks`  
**Parameters**: Optional task name to analyze specific task

**What it does**:
- Conducts web research for each task using web_search
- Researches React Native/Expo best practices
- Identifies common challenges and solutions
- Assigns complexity scores (1-10 scale)
- Documents research findings
- Recommends tasks for expansion

**Complexity Scoring**:
- **1-3**: Simple, straightforward implementation
- **4-6**: Moderate, requires some research/setup
- **7-8**: Complex, multiple moving parts
- **9-10**: Very complex, high risk of blockers

**Example Usage**:
```
/analyze-complexity                    # Analyze all tasks
/analyze-complexity Authentication     # Analyze specific task
```

**Research Areas**:
- Technical complexity and implementation approaches
- Required dependencies and setup requirements
- Common gotchas and potential blockers
- Time estimates from development communities
- Best practices and patterns

- Defines clear acceptance criteria for each subtask
- Sets up dependency chains between subtasks
- Maintains logical development sequence

**Subtask Criteria**:
- Maximum 4 hours estimated time

## üéØ Advanced Usage Patterns

### Command Sequences

#### **Project Initialization**:
```bash
/parse-prd              # Generate task backlog
/analyze-complexity     # Research all tasks
/expand-all            # Break down complex tasks
/emergency-context     # Load full context
/start-task           # Begin first task
```

#### **Daily Development Flow**:
```bash
/emergency-context     # Start of session
/task-progress        # Update current work
/complete-task        # When finished
/start-task          # Begin next task
```

#### **Weekly Maintenance**:
```bash
/sync-tasks           # Clean up task list
/emergency-context    # Refresh full context
```

### Command Combinations

#### **For Complex Features**:
```bash
/add-discovered-task   # Add the complex feature
/analyze-complexity [feature-name]  # Research complexity
/expand-task [feature-name]         # Break into subtasks
```

#### **When Stuck or Blocked**:
```bash
/emergency-context     # Reload full context
/sync-tasks           # Clean up any confusion
/start-task          # Find alternative task
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Common Command Errors

#### **Command Not Found**
```
Error: /parse-prd is not recognized
```
**Solutions**:
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Verify `.claude/commands/parse-prd.md` exists
3. Check file has content (not empty)

#### **Missing Prerequisites**
```
Error: claude_tasks.md must exist with task backlog
```
**Solutions**:
1. Run `/parse-prd` first to generate tasks
2. Check PRD.md exists and has content
3. Verify project setup is complete

#### **Context Loading Issues**
```
Warning: No project context found in memory
```
**Solutions**:
1. Run `/emergency-context` to reload
2. Check PRD.md and claude_tasks.md exist
3. Re-run `/parse-prd` if necessary

### Command-Specific Troubleshooting

#### `/parse-prd` Issues
- **No tasks generated**: PRD.md needs more detail
- **Wrong categories**: Update PRD features section
- **Missing phases**: Ensure Phase 1/2 distinction clear

#### `/analyze-complexity` Issues
- **No research results**: Check internet connection
- **Incomplete analysis**: Re-run for specific tasks
- **Wrong complexity scores**: Review research findings

#### `/start-task` Issues
- **No available tasks**: Check dependencies and blockers
- **Wrong task selected**: Review priority and phase settings
- **Task already in progress**: Use `/task-progress` instead

## üìö Best Practices

### Command Usage Guidelines
1. **Always start sessions** with `/emergency-context`
2. **Use `/task-progress` frequently** during development
3. **Complete tasks properly** with `/complete-task`
4. **Add discovered tasks immediately** with `/add-discovered-task`
5. **Maintain organization** with weekly `/sync-tasks`

### Quality Assurance
- Every task should have clear acceptance criteria
- All completed tasks should be tested
- Documentation should be updated continuously
- Patterns should be recorded in claude_self_improve.md

### Performance Tips
- Use tab completion for file references in Claude Code
- Keep task descriptions specific and actionable
- Break large tasks before starting work
- Document decisions immediately to preserve context
